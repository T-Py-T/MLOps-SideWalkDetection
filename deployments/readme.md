# MLOps Pipeline Improvements for SideWalkDetection

## Current State Analysis

**Strengths of Your Current Implementation:**

- Comprehensive data processing pipeline (30+ PC scripts)
- Multiple training approaches (MobileNetV2, Coral TPU)
- Geographic-specific models (LA, Denver, Niwot)
- Production-ready Raspberry Pi deployment
- Multiple deployment modes and configurations

**Manual Processes to Automate:**

- Video upload and processing workflow
- Training trigger management across Colab notebooks
- Model deployment to Pi devices
- Geographic model selection and updates

## Phase 1: Automated Data Pipeline

### Cloud Storage Integration

```python
# Replace manual video uploads with automated pipeline
# Trigger existing pc/ scripts automatically

import functions_framework
from google.cloud import storage
import subprocess

@functions_framework.cloud_event
def process_new_video(cloud_event):
    # Download video from cloud storage
    # Run createTrainingSet.py automatically
    # Execute normalizeImages.py and cropImages.py
    # Update database with build_db.py
    # Trigger training when threshold reached
```

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Set up Cloud Storage bucket for video uploads
2. Create Cloud Function that triggers your existing `pc/` scripts
3. Automate `build_db.py` and `db_filter.py` execution
4. Configure automatic training triggers

### Existing Script Integration

- **Data Processing**: Automate `createTrainingSet.py` → `normalizeImages.py` → `cropImages.py` pipeline
- **Quality Control**: Trigger `removeLowVelocityImages.py` and `sortTrainingImages.py`
- **Geographic Processing**: Automate location-specific processing with `process_LA_images.py`

## Phase 2: Training Orchestration

### Colab Notebook Automation

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow
name: Automated Training Pipeline
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 0'  # Weekly Sunday 2AM
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      location:
        description: 'Training location (LA, Denver, Niwot)'
        required: true
        type: choice
        options: ['LA', 'Denver', 'Niwot']

jobs:
  train_model:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Execute Colab Training
        run: |
          # Trigger Train_new_MobileNet_V2_model.ipynb
          # Run location-specific data processing
          # Execute model evaluation notebooks
```

**Training Pipeline Automation:**

- **Papermill Integration**: Execute your Colab notebooks programmatically
- **Geographic Training**: Automate model training for each city
- **Model Evaluation**: Run `Evaluate_TFLite_sidewalk_model.ipynb` automatically
- **Coral TPU Training**: Trigger `Train_sidewalk_coral.ipynb` for edge optimization

### Location-Aware Training

```python
# Automated geographic model management
def train_location_model(location):
    if location == "LA":
        run_notebook("Train_new_MobileNet_V2_model.ipynb", {"data_path": "LA_data/"})
        process_script("process_LA_images.py")
    elif location == "Denver":
        # Denver-specific processing
    elif location == "Niwot":
        # Niwot-specific processing
    
    # Always run evaluation
    run_notebook("Evaluate_TFLite_sidewalk_model.ipynb")
```

## Phase 3: Deployment Automation

### Fleet Management System

```python
# Automated Pi deployment management
class FleetDeployment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pi_devices = self.discover_devices()
    
    def deploy_model(self, model_path, location, rollout_percentage=10):
        # Select devices by geographic location
        target_devices = self.get_devices_by_location(location)
        
        # Gradual rollout
        deployment_targets = target_devices[:int(len(target_devices) * rollout_percentage/100)]
        
        for device in deployment_targets:
            self.upload_model(device, model_path)
            self.restart_scooter_service(device)
            self.monitor_performance(device)
```

**Deployment Features:**

- **Geographic Deployment**: Deploy appropriate model based on Pi location
- **Service Management**: Automate `run_scooter_limit_speed` deployment
- **Rollback Capability**: Revert to previous model if performance degrades
- **Health Monitoring**: Monitor Pi device status and model performance

### Existing Script Enhancement

- **Automated Startup**: Enhance `startup.sh` with model version checking
- **Configuration Management**: Automate deployment mode selection
- **Performance Monitoring**: Add telemetry to `scooter.py` and `cnn.py`

## Phase 4: Advanced MLOps Features

### Model Performance Monitoring

```python
# Enhance existing scooter.py with telemetry
class ModelMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {}
    
    def log_inference(self, image, prediction, confidence, speed_action):
        # Log prediction confidence
        # Track speed limiting frequency
        # Monitor geographic performance differences
        # Alert on confidence degradation
```

### Automated A/B Testing

- **Model Comparison**: Test new models against existing ones
- **Geographic A/B**: Compare model performance across cities
- **Safety Metrics**: Monitor pedestrian detection accuracy
- **Performance Tracking**: Inference time and resource usage

- **Existing Hardware**: Optimize current Pi deployment
- **Minimal Cloud Costs**: Only pay for storage and functions

**Resource Efficiency:**

- **Scheduled Training**: Off-peak hours for cost reduction
- **Geographic Optimization**: Train only when new data available per city
- **Model Sharing**: Reuse base models across geographic locations

## Key Metrics to Track

**Technical Metrics:**

- Training automation success rate
- Deployment time reduction (current manual vs automated)
- Model performance consistency across geographic regions
- Pi device uptime and health

**Business Metrics:**

- Speed limiting activation frequency
- Pedestrian detection accuracy in production
