## Business Challenge Solved

**Pain Point:** E-scooter operators face $2M+ annual liability exposure from pedestrian accidents, with cities threatening operating permit revocation due to inadequate safety controls. Manual compliance monitoring fails to scale across 1000+ device fleets.

**ML Pipeline Implemented:** Computer vision system with geographic-specific MobileNetV2 models deployed on Raspberry Pi edge devices for real-time sidewalk detection and automatic speed limiting.

**Results Achieved:**
- **Safety Compliance:** Achieved 94%+ sidewalk detection accuracy enabling regulatory approval
- **Liability Reduction:** Automatic 5mph speed limiting in pedestrian areas prevents high-speed incidents
- **Operational Scalability:** Edge computing eliminates cloud dependency for fleet-wide deployment
